# Project: High Availability Infrastructure Deployment

## Overview

This project focuses on deploying a high-availability infrastructure using Terraform. It targets key components such as AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) for database management and Kubernetes for container orchestration. The primary goal is to establish a robust, scalable infrastructure suitable for production environments.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several key directories, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the infrastructure setup:

- **zone1/**: Contains Terraform configurations for deploying infrastructure components in Zone 1.
- **zone2/**: Contains Terraform configurations for deploying infrastructure components in Zone 2.
- **modules/**: Reusable Terraform modules for RDS instances and Kubernetes clusters.
- **scripts/**: Scripts that automate deployment and management tasks.

### Terraform Configurations

The configurations are organized into two zones to ensure redundancy and increased availability:

- **Zone 1 and Zone 2**: Each zone has tailored configurations for setting up RDS instances and Kubernetes clusters.

#### RDS Instances

Configured for high availability, the RDS instances are deployed across multiple availability zones to ensure automatic failover and continuous availability.

#### Kubernetes Clusters

The Kubernetes clusters are designed to be highly available and include configurations for multi-node setups with auto-scaling to efficiently manage varying loads.

## Getting Started

To deploy the infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. **Review** the Terraform configurations and scripts to familiarize yourself with the deployment processes.
2. **Navigate** to either the `zone1/` or `zone2/` directory, depending on which zone you intend to deploy.
3. **Execute** the following command to apply the Terraform configurations:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
This command initiates the deployment of the infrastructure components as defined in the respective zone's configurations.
