Project: High Availability Infrastructure Deployment
Overview
This project deploys a high-availability infrastructure using Terraform, with a focus on RDS (Relational Database Service) and Kubernetes. The goal of this project is to create a highly available and scalable infrastructure for a production environment.

Project Structure
This directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

zone1/: Terraform configurations for deploying infrastructure in Zone 1
zone2/: Terraform configurations for deploying infrastructure in Zone 2
modules/: Reusable Terraform modules for deploying RDS instances and Kubernetes clusters
scripts/: Scripts for automating deployment and management tasks
Terraform Configurations
The Terraform configurations in this project are organized into two zones: Zone 1 and Zone 2. Each zone has its own set of configurations for deploying RDS instances and Kubernetes clusters.

RDS Instances
The RDS instances in this project are configured to be highly available, with multiple availability zones and automatic failover.

Kubernetes Clusters
The Kubernetes clusters in this project are configured to be highly available, with multiple nodes and automatic scaling.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, please review the Terraform configurations and scripts provided. You can deploy the infrastructure by running terraform apply in the zone1/ or zone2/ directories.
